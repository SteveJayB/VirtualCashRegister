This program acts as a virtual cash resister by displaying what cash in drawer is available in denominations of hundreds, twneties, tens, fives, ones, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. It also displays a total price, if the register is open or not, and accepts a cash value from a customer. Once the cash value is obtained from the customer, the cash register will determine if the customer has enough cash to purchase, if the cash is the same amount as the price (paid in full), or how much change the cutomer needs to receive. Once it determines how much change the customer will need to receieve, it will displays the denominations and value the customer gets back. For example, if the total is $3.75 and the customer gives us $5, the program will determine the customer needs $1.25 in change and will display "Status: OPEN, ONE: $1, QUARTER: $0.25" as well as subtract those amounts from the cash in drawer so that the updated cash in drawer value is displayed.
